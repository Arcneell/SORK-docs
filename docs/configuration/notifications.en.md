# Notification Configuration

SORK sends notifications across multiple channels for important events: outages, repairs, autoscaling, automatic updates, backups, manifest errors, etc.

## Supported Channels

| Channel | Webhook Type | Required Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Discord | Webhook URL | `webhook_url` |
| Slack | Incoming Webhook | `webhook_url` |
| Microsoft Teams | Incoming Webhook | `webhook_url` |
| Telegram | Bot API | `bot_token` + `chat_id` |
| SMTP (email) | SMTP Server | `host`, `user`, `pass`, `from`, `to` |

## Configuration

Edit `etc/notify.ini`. Each channel is an independent section; enable the ones you want:

```ini

enabled = 1
webhook_url = https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ

[teams]
enabled = 0
webhook_url = https://outlook.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/XXX/IncomingWebhook/YYY/ZZZ

[telegram]
enabled = 0
bot_token = YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
chat_id = YOUR_CHAT_ID

[smtp]
enabled = 0
host = smtp.example.com
port = 587
user = alerts@example.com
pass = secret
from = alerts@example.com
to = admin@example.com
```

### Reason Codes

Each notification includes a translated reason code:

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| `curl_failed` | curl request failed |
| `oom_killed` | Container killed due to out of memory (OOM) |
| `memory_hard` | Critical memory threshold exceeded |
| `memory_soft` | Warning memory threshold exceeded |
| `http_5xx` | HTTP 5xx response code |
| `tcp_refused` | TCP connection refused |
| `high_latency` | Response time too high |
| `high_error_rate` | HTTP error rate too high |
| `disk_full` | Disk usage too high |
| `log_anomaly` | Anomaly detected in logs |

## Anti-Spam

SORK avoids notification spam:

- Certain incidents are marked to avoid duplicates in tight loops
- Recovery notifications are sent only once per restoration
- The `manifest_load_warn.notified` flag prevents repeated alerts for the same manifest error
- Non-blocking log anomaly notifications have a 10-minute cooldown per service
